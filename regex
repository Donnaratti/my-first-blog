Regular Expressions (regex): 

These are normal used with django....

	    ^ for the beginning of the text
	    $ for the end of the text
	    \d for a digit
	    + to indicate that the previous item should be repeated at least once
	    () to capture part of the pattern

taking /post/12345/ as an example, where 12345 is the number of a post.
Create pattern ^post?(\d+)/$:

	^post/ is telling django to take anything that has post/ at the beginning of the url
	(\d+) tells django there will be a number, one or more digits and that we want the number captured and extracted. 
	/ tells django that another / character should follow. 
	$ then indicates the end of the URL meaning that only strings ending with the / will match this pattern. 


When writing regex in Python, it always starts with "r". This tells python the following string contains special characters for regular expressions. 


url(r'^post/(?P<pk>\d+)/$', views.post_detail, name='post_detail') EXPLAINED!!!
(?P<pk>\d+): this means that Django will take everything that you place here abd transfer it to a view as a variable called pk. (NOTE: this matches the name given to the primary key variable back in blog/templates/blog/post_list.html)
\d tells us that it can only be a digit, not a letter and + means that there needs to be one or more digits there. 
NOT VALID: /post//		VALID: /post/12345/
if you enter .../post/5/ into the browser, django will understand that you are looking for a view called post_detail and transfer the info that pk equals 5 to that view.
